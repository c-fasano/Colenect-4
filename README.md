History

Connect 4 is a 1 on 1 game that is easy to learn, accessible and fun while still allowing room for challenge and competition between players. Modern Connect 4 was largely inspired by Funtastic's "Score 4" game they created in the late 1960's. Lucky for us, the design of the game has since been simplified making it that much more fun to play. 

Today's standard Connect 4 boards have a total of 42 slots (6 rows, 7 columns). With a board this size, there are some impressive numbers worth noting:
  
  1. There is a total of 69 different winning combinations 
  
  2. According to YouTube channel, NumberPhile, there are a total of 4,531,985,219,092 possible moves that can be made!! Despite this there are individuals who have solved Connect 4 meaning they have developed numerous strategies in order to guarantee a win every single time. 


Rules of the game:

  1. Each player will be assigned a color when the game begins. 

  2. When it is their turn the players will choose the column they would like to place their next chip. Remember that you can choose the column but your chip will automatically fall to the lowest available row within that selected column. 

  3. A player wins if they are able to line up 4 of their chips consecutively. This can be in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal arrangement.
