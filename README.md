## History

Connect 4 is a 1 on 1 game that is easy to learn, accessible and fun while still allowing room for challenge and competition between players. Modern Connect 4 was largely inspired by Funtastic's "Score 4" game they created in the late 1960's. Lucky for us, the design of the game has since been simplified making it that much more fun to play. 

Today's standard Connect 4 boards have a total of 42 slots (6 rows, 7 columns). With a board this size, there are some impressive numbers worth noting:
